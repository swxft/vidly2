### 1. Clone The Repo
`git clone https://github.com/swxft/vidly2.git`

### 2. Run via Docker
- make sure you've manually turned Docker on locally
- in the cli 👇
`docker-compose up` 

### 3. Use the App
Create and delete as many movies as you'd like at `localhost:3000`. `docker ps` to check what ports are in use. you may need to `docker kill` one if it's running on that `3000` port 😉.

### 4. Shut Docker Down
`docker-compose down`
